[**Buildware 3D**]({{ site.baseUrl }}/{{ page.portfolioUrl }}) is a Windows CAD modeler software from the early 2000s written in C++ and based on the OpenCASCADE engine and OpenGL. Has 2D/3D modelling environment for interactive construction of geometry primitives, coordinate systems, layers, snapping, print layouts, property list UI. Heavy use of COM (the predecessor of .NET). Has a small core and modular design for high flexibility and extensibility through a custom plug-in framework based on COM interfaces. I was a member of the team of 3-5 developers.

**Environment**: Visual C++, MFC, COM, ATL, IDL, WinAPI, GDI, OpenGL, [OpenCASCADE](https://www.opencascade.com/), [Prof-UIS](http://www.prof-uis.com/).

Highlights of my participation in the project:

- Working with very large codebase;
- Extending the existing codebase with additional features, improving legacy code, bug fixing;
- Responsible for the GUI and the plug-in subsystems;
- Implementing COM plugins which provide interactive operations over visual geometry objects like polylines, splines, boxes, prisms and more.
  - Boolean operations (Cut, Union, Intersection);
  - 2D operations (Move, Rotate, Mirror, Scale);
  - 3D operations (Fillet, Chamfer, Extrude);
- Integration of the Prof-UIS MFC GUI library: implementing multi-pane layout, tree-view, toolbars, menus and a multi-selection PropertyGrid with binding to COM objects;
- Participated in an effort to integrate a parametric CAD modelling core provided by OpenCASCADE.
