The customer was in the wrist watch industry. The project had Android and iOS applications and complex image
recognition backend logic. The client is a worldwide electronics company, primary known for its watches; it is
also the core company is a Japanese global corporate group based in Tokyo.

I had 2 distinct roles in the project:

1. Python backend developer
May 2018 – June 2018

Implemented a small image recognizer backend with Python and Google Cloud Vision API. Image pre-processing,
calibration and analysis with OpenCV. Post-processing with various Machine Learning techniques for optimizing
the recognition rate. The recognizer was written as a standalone Python command line tool which then was
wrapped into a Java Spring REST service. The system was able to recognize a concrete watch model from a
photo within >90% probability.

**Technical skills and tools**: Python, Google Cloud Vision API, OpenCV, image processing.

2. Android developer
July 2018 – Sep 2018

I was responsible for developing the Android client. It was a non-Material style app with about 16 screens and
relatively complex navigation flows. The app included camera, files downloader, authentication with Facebook
and Google accounts, notifications, synchronization with the REST backend. I have combined successfully some
latest technologies and advancements in the Android industry: 100% Kotlin, MVI fully reactive unidirectional
flow, immutable models. The result was a stable app with a small, easily testable and clean codebase.

**Technical skills and tools**: Android: Kotlin, KotlinX, Dagger-Android, OkHttp3, Retrofit2, RxJava2, Moshi,
Mosby-MVI, Fotoapparat, ThreeTenABP, Glide, Timber, LeakCanary, Junit, Espresso, Mockito.
