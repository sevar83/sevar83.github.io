**PanelHome3D** is an innovative Java desktop CAD software developed for a companies, producers of [polystyrene panels for building construction](http://www.cngoodsindex.com/Product/Daquan_FPB1500_3000_610_EPS_Sandwich_Panels_eps_sandwich_panel_prefabricated_house-792438082_6_465.jpg). It is a heavily customized fork of the popular open-source project [SweetHome 3D](http://www.sweethome3d.com/). Sketching of simple building construction plans of buildings. Analyzes the entire [building geometry](https://sc01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1S_diIFXXXXcuaXXXq6xXFXXXe/OBON-low-cost-house-construction-material-polystyrene.jpg) (walls, floor, ceiling, roof) and automatically generates a list of precise geometry shapes of the sliced panel pieces. The output geometry data is collected and formatted into a book of printable sheets. This book is a plan for the construction workers to assemble to panel pieces into walls.
