**Buildware 3D** is a Windows CAD modeler software from the early 2000s written in C++ and based on the OpenCASCADE engine and OpenGL. Has 2D/3D modelling environment for interactive construction of geometry primitives, coordinate systems, layers, snapping, print layouts, property list UI. Heavy use of COM (the predecessor of .NET). Has a small core and modular design for high flexibility and extensibility through a custom plug-in framework based on COM interfaces. I was a member of the team of 3-5 developers.

**Environment**: Visual C++, MFC, COM, ATL, IDL, WinAPI, GDI, OpenGL, [OpenCASCADE](https://www.opencascade.com/), [Prof-UIS](http://www.prof-uis.com/).
